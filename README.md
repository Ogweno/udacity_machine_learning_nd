## Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Projects



This repository contains six projects for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Program. 

### Codes and Libraies
All of the projects 
requires Python 2.7 or 3 I have Used python 3.0. The following Python libraries are also required:

<li> NumPy
<li> Pandas
<li> matplotlib
<li> scikit-learn
<li> Keras

### Projects:

<b>P0: Titanic Survival Exploration</b>

In this optional project, I created decision functions that attempt to 
predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s 
features, such as sex and age. I started with a simple algorithm and increase its 
complexity until I was able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in 
the provided data.

<b>P1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices</b>

The Boston housing market is highly competitive. 
The main objective of the project was to find the best selling price for home in Boston area. The Boston Housing dataset 
contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median 
value of homes for each of those areas. I have used DecisionTreeRegressor algorithom to make model based on a statistical analysis with 
the tools available.


<b> P2: Finding Donors for CharityML </b>

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established 
to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters sent to
people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making
more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents 
of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, 
CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead 
cost of sending mail.

<b> P3: Creating Customer Segments </b>

A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a 
morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week.Initial testing 
did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. 
Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were 
canceling deliveries — losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. I have used unsupervised algorithoms
ICA and Gaussian mixer model to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business 
decisions in the future.

<b> P4: Train a Smartcab to Drive </b>

In the not-so-distant future, taxicab companies across the United States no longer employ human drivers to 
operate their fleet of vehicles. Instead, the taxicabs are operated by self-driving agents — known as smartcabs — 
to transport people from one location to another within the cities those companies operate. In major metropolitan 
areas, such as Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco, an increasing number of people have come to rely on 
smartcabs to get to where they need to go as safely and efficiently as possible. Although smartcabs have become 
the transport of choice, concerns have arose that a self-driving agent might not be as safe or efficient as human 
drivers, particularly when considering city traffic lights and other vehicles. To alleviate these concerns, I used 
reinforcement learning techniques to construct a demonstration of a smartcab operating in real-time to prove that 
both safety and efficiency can be achieved.
